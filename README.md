refactoring101
==============

The code here, represented as steps, is the progression of a refactoring on a legacy codebase. It is a PHP version of the Java code shown in the Martin Fowler book "Refactoring". http://www.refactoring.com/

The code is based on PHP 5+ object model, so older versions of PHP will not work.

NOTE: While this series of files/steps highlights common refactorings, it is not supposed to representative of "great code".  By that I mean there is still more refactoring/work to be done to make it perfect.  These files are meant for training only, and not meant to be completed project.

* 013-condition_to_polymorphism.php
* 014-condition_to_polymorphism.php

How to use these files:
-----------------------

These files are best used by doing a diff-type side-by-side view of the previous and next versions.  I have included a doc block in the head of each file that explains the changes, and in some cases why they were done. However, it is best to look at the code itself to see what was done with each iteration.

Enjoy!
